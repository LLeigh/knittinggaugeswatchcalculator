Knitting Gauge Calculator - READ ME

My goal with this program is to create a guide for knitter's who may be intimidated by the math that 
is involved with figuring out what to do when their knitting gauge does not match the gauge for which 
the pattern was written.

What is Knitting Gauge?

Knitting gauge is a term used to describe stitches per inch.  Most patterns use a 4-inch gauge swatch 
to illustrate stitches across (side to side) and stitches in rows (top to bottom). The gauge is defined 
by length by rows. An example of a knitting gauge swatch would be 16 x 24, which would be 16 stitches 
per 4 inch in length and 24 rows per 4 inches top to bottom.

When a knitter chooses a pattern to knit, it is recommeneded they knit their own 4 inch by 4 inch 
swatch to determine what size they should knit. This is especially important for patterns for garments 
that need to fit. There are a lot of factors that can affect a knitters gauge from not matching the 
pattern's gauge : tension, yarn weight, needle size. Most patterns will recommend yarn weight and needle 
size, BUT if a knitter gets comfortable with calculating gauge they are less limited to what yarn or 
needle they can use.

Calculating Knitting Gauge

Calculate knitting gauge and what size pattern to knit requires getting measurements of the person the 
garment is being made for, getting inforations from the pattern, and, of course, knitting and getting 
the measurements a swatch. The knitting gauge calculator walks through, step by step, the necessary 
calculations and information needs to determine what size garment the knitter should knit.
